# Project: CSS Selectors & Units

**DUE:** Wednesday, Oct. 23, Noon.

This project is worth **ten (10) points.**


## Instructions

This project is designed to have you build a simple web page and focus on applying selectors and use relative units. The outcome of this will project will serve as a foundation for future assignments.

1. Fork this repository. Clone the forked repository to your computer. (If you clone the repository in `umiami-front-end` you will be unable to push changes.) You may work in the `master` branch or create a separate one if you prefer.

2. Find a recipe from [Public Domain Recipes](https://publicdomainrecipes.org). The recipe should have at least five ingredients and five steps (instructions).

3. Find a photo to accompany the recipe on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/). Note the photographer's name for credit later. Save the original image in a directory called `original` in your repo. Edit the image in Photoshop so its dimensions fit your design. Your image may not exceed 300kb in file size. (It probably should be much less.) Store the edited image in an `img` or `images` directory.

4. Use the `recipe.html` boilerplate provided in this repo. Rename it so it reflects what your recipe is. For instance, if your recipe is for waffles, name it `waffles.html`.

5. Add the recipe information to the `.html` document using the structure provided. Be sure to include the recipe name, yield, ingredients, instructions, author and source. Mark up your content using appropriate semantic tags (i.e., if it's a list, it should be a list). Include the image and source. You **may not** use `id` or `class` attributes. Make sure your HTML is [valid](https://validator.w3.org).

6. Add styling to the page. Store this `.css` file in a `css` directory. You may create any design you want, but it needs to be more than just styling fonts and colors. Make it look a lot better than what appears on the Public Domain Recipes web site. Make it presentable, as if you were creating your own recipe site. Your code must adhere to the limitations below:

  **CSS Selectors:** You are not permitted to add any `id` or `class` attribute to the HTML. Therefore, you may not use id or class selectors in your CSS. You may use type, attribute, descendant, child, general sibling, adjacent sibling selectors, pseudo-classes, pseudo-elements and the comma (combining) selector in your CSS.

  **CSS Units:** You may only use pixels with the `border` property. All other units must be a relative unit, either `rem` or `em`. You are free to choose whichever you prefer.

7. When finished, commit your work.

8. *Skip this step if you do not want to see your page live on the web.*

	On GitHub, in the repo settings, scroll down to GitHub Pages. Under source, choose the branch which your work resides. The page should build after your next push to GitHub.

9. Push the changes to your repo.

10. Email Prof. Brown the link to your *repo* no later than noon on Wednesday, Oct. 23.


## Example

A sample of what a completed project should look like can be found at [https://github.com/ebrown15/waffles](http://github.com/ebrown15/waffles).

Note it is a pretty simple design, but it takes into account font pairings, balanced whitespace, touches on the image, link color, hover effect, etc. You can also get an idea of how much code you are expected to write.

*Note: This design or code may not be reproduced for your assignment(s).* Your work is to be original.

## Reminder

Images must be stored in your repo. Do not "hot link." All content must be sourced. Failure to adhere to these requirements will constitute a lapse of web ethics and result in a zero (0) on this assignment.


## Grading

Projects submitted past the due date will receive a zero (0).

Submissions will receive deductions for any missed steps as well as the following:

- Limited/incomplete designs
- Use of ids, classes in HTML
- Use of id and/or class selectors in CSS
- Use of pixels (other than for a `border`)

**Good luck!**
